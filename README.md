# MyCompany Database
Desktop Application for a Google Sheets project, implementing Google Sheets API

Created a Desktop Application using JavaFX to support an already existing Google Sheets project I managed for a company who specializes in recruiting.

Because the information on the actual database is sensitive, I made a copy of the original database, and changed all the sensitive information, to protect the applicants data.

Because over time new Information has been asked from the candidates, the first rows of the Google Forms are not complete, and I maintained the information from the first few ever applicants, back in 2020.

Because the viewing experience of the data itself is not the best, the goal of this project was to create a piece of software where the company could view the applicants information separated into categories, as well as still be able to edit the information accordingly, and have it update itself on the Google Sheets database.
