# MyCompany Database
Desktop Application for a Google Sheets project, implementing Google Sheets API

Created a Desktop Application using JavaFX to support an already existing Google Sheets project I managed for a company who specializes in recruiting.

Because the information on the actual database is sensitive, I made a copy of the original database, and changed all the sensitive information, to protect the applicants data.

Because over time new Information has been asked from the candidates, the first rows of the Google Forms are not complete, and I maintained the information from the first few ever applicants, back in 2020.

Because the viewing experience of the data itself is not the best, the goal of this project was to create a piece of software where the company could view the applicants information separated into categories, as well as still be able to edit the information accordingly, and have it update itself on the Google Sheets database.

As a reference, in the database itself, as other tabs, I had created a form-like view for the candidates, where you copy and paste the ID number into the first cell, and the candidates information will be loaded. Additionally, theres a report tab, which is generated from the form tab, where the recruiter can fill out important information to pass on to the companies about the candidate. This function to generate reports is something I would also like to implement in the future in this project.

Because the database was created Google Forms and Google Sheets, I had to learn a little bit about the Google Sheets API and the Google Cloud console. 

Should the program require access from the Google Cloud Console, please feel free to reach out.
