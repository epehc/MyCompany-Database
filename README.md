# PROreclutamiento
Desktop Application for a Google Sheets project, implementing Google Sheets API

Created a Desktop Application using JavaFX to support an already existing Google Sheets project I managed for the company of a family member.

The company is named PROreclutamiento, a recruiting company based in Guatemala.

The goal was, to create an easier viewing experience and to easily manage the information on the spreadsheet itself.
